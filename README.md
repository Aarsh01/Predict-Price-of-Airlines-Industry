# Predict-Price-of-Airlines-Industry

The project begins by introducing the business problem and dataset, providing an overview of the datasets and resources in just over a minute. Data go through data preprocessing, featuring a step-by-step process of extracting derived features and performing data cleaning. The journey continues with an exploration of data analysis, delving into the impact of duration on price and conducting bi-variate analysis.

Moving into the realm of feature encoding, the project covers techniques such as one-hot encoding, target-guided encoding, and manual label encoding. It also addresses the crucial task of handling outliers in data and selecting the best features through feature selection

The project unfolds the intricacies of decision trees, spanning multiple parts to ensure a comprehensive understanding. Linear regression is demystified in a three-part series, followed by a detailed exploration of KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) in four parts. The project concludes with valuable insights into automating the machine learning pipeline, understanding cross-validation, and effectively hyper-tuning machine learning models.

Throughout the journey, I am empowered with the knowledge and skills needed to tackle real-world data science challenges, making the project a holistic and practical guide from start to finish.
